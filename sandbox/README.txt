This application provides the basic structure of the final project's phone application.
The app opens to the home screen, which provides options to view data via the launch or 
demo mode. Both buttons open the app's main data display screen. Alternatively, the user 
can select to edit the settings for data collection and display. The settings are saved 
for future use in the app.
