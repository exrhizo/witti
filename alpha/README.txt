Release Description: 
This application provides the basic structure of the final project's phone application.
The app opens to the home screen, which provides options to view data via the launch or 
demo mode. Both buttons open the app's main data display screen. Alternatively, the user 
can select to edit the settings for data collection and display. The settings are saved 
for future use in the app.

Minimum SKD version: 11

Use: This app uses openGL, which doesn't work on the emulator

After loadin onto a device the home screen has options:

Launch/Demo - these go to the display activity which loads opengl renderers and a number of points. The points are not displaying. LogCat shows the number of points loaded and that the shaders and texture is loaded correctly.

Settings - A menu that allows you to browse settings

Path Drawing - A Simple drawing utility that allows the user to create a path for displaying.
