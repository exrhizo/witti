Application Description: This application visualizes LiDAR data on a mobile device in both 
demo mode and launch mode. Demo mode displays prerecorded data saved on the mobile device, 
whereas launch mode displays data stored on a web server. The user can change 
the server location and selected files to display using the application settings. 
Additionally, the user can display the data in both manual mode, which requires the user 
to select when to update the data displayed, and auto-refresh mode, which updates the data
displayed automatically at a set rate. Another setting allows the launch mode to be 
configured to receive live data from the LiDAR. Finally, the user can manipulate the
perspecitve of the data displayed in either demo or launch mode.
